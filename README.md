For my original project, I was working on it Friday at around 1 PM when my castle prefab became corrupted. I had not saved my project for a few minutes so I restarted the program in hopes to recover the prefab. This in turn deleted all of my assets and prefabs and I decided to cut my losses and restart the entire project. I know its a few hours late and doesn't quite fit all the requirements, but I worked on this the best of my ability in as short of time as I could. Please be kind when grading and have a nice day.
